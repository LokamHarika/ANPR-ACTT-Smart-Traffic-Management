**ANPR & ATCC System**
**Overview**
This project is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and Automated Traffic Control & Compliance (ATCC) system that utilizes YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 for real-time vehicle monitoring. It is designed to enhance traffic management by detecting and analyzing various violations.

**Key Features**
**âœ” ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition):** Detects and extracts vehicle license plates using advanced YOLO models.
**âœ” ATCC (Automated Traffic Control & Compliance):** Monitors traffic flow and detects rule violations.
**âœ” Helmet Detection:** Identifies two-wheeler riders without helmets.
**âœ” Triple Riding Detection:** Flags instances where more than two people are riding a two-wheeler.
**âœ” Accident Detection:** Recognizes accident scenarios using deep learning.
**âœ” Emergency Vehicle Detection:** Identifies ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles to prioritize their movement.

**Technologies Used**
Backend: Flask, Python
Frontend: React.js
Machine Learning Models: YOLOv8, YOLOv9, PyTesseract-OCR, Computer Vision
Database: MySQL
Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

Python (>=3.11)
Node.js & npm (for frontend)
Flask
React.js
OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch
YOLOv8 & YOLOv9 (Ultralytics)
PyTesseract-OCR
Deployment Steps
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/peacefularmaan/Smart_Traffix.git
Step 2: Backend Setup
Navigate to the project directory and start the backend:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Alternatively, you can run app.py using the "Run Python File" option in your IDE.

Step 3: Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd FrontEnd
npm install  # Install dependencies
npm run dev  # Start the frontend server
This will launch the React-based user interface, and a local host link will appear in the terminal. Click the link to open the web app.

Step 4: Login to the System
When the login page appears, enter the credentials:

Username: user
Password: pass
Once logged in, the dashboard will be accessible for real-time monitoring.

You're All Set! ðŸŽ¯
The ANPR & ATCC System is now fully operational! You can now monitor vehicle activities, detect violations, and improve road safety with AI-driven automation.
